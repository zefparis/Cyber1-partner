# Email Introduction - Cyber1 Partnership

**Subject:** POC Partnership Opportunity - SASSA Fraud Intelligence + Shield Module

---

Hi [Cyber1 Contact Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Benjamin Barrère, Founder & CTO of IA Solution. We've developed HCS-U7, a cognitive biometric authentication platform with a unique Shield Module for detecting state-level network attacks (IMSI catchers, GPS spoofing, impossible travel).

## Why I'm reaching out

I've been advised that Cyber1 is the ideal partner for a POC with SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) to address their massive fraud exposure (R10-30B/year estimated leakage).

Our solution offers a **dual value proposition** perfectly aligned with your SOC and government practice:

### 1. Fraud Intelligence (Offline)
- Behavioral anomaly detection
- Investigative lead generation
- Post-payment fraud identification
- Zero production system risk

### 2. Shield Module (Unique to Market)
- IMSI catcher detection (corrupt agents using Stingray devices)
- Impossible travel detection (syndicated identity theft)
- GPS spoofing detection (eligibility fraud)

## Why this makes sense for Cyber1

- **Leverages your existing SASSA relationship** and government credibility
- **Positions you as innovation leader** (first Shield deployment in Africa)
- **Opens new revenue stream** (risk intelligence as a service)
- **Low risk** (offline POC, no production integration)
- **High impact** (R50M+ fraud identified in 90 days)

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **30-minute intro call** to share POC deck (20 slides)
2. **If aligned**, joint meeting with SASSA stakeholder
3. **MOU** on partnership structure (prime integrator model)

## Attached

- POC SASSA Pitch Deck (PDF, 20 slides)
- HCS-U7 Technical Overview (PDF, 1-pager)
- Shield Module Datasheet (PDF, 2 pages)

Would you be available for a brief call this week or next?

Best regards,

Hi [Name],

Quick intro - I'm Benjamin, CTO of IA Solution. We've built HCS-U7, 
a fraud intelligence platform with a unique Shield Module that detects 
IMSI catchers and GPS spoofing.

Looking for a partner to approach SASSA (R200B+ grants, massive fraud exposure).
Cyber1's government expertise + our tech = compelling POC proposal.

90-day offline POC, zero production risk, R50M+ fraud identified.

Worth a 20-min call?

Benjamin

**Subject:** Re: POC Partnership Opportunity - SASSA Fraud Intelligence + Shield Module

Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous email regarding a potential SASSA POC partnership.

I understand you're busy, so here's the TL;DR:

- **Problem**: SASSA loses R10-30B/year to fraud
- **Solution**: HCS-U7 Shield Module (detects IMSI catchers, GPS spoofing)
- **Opportunity**: 90-day offline POC, R50M+ fraud identified
- **Ask**: 20-minute call to explore partnership

If this isn't the right time, no worries - happy to reconnect in Q1 2026.

Best,
Benjamin

   - Prime integrator role (project management, SASSA relationship)
   - Revenue share: 60-70% Cyber1 / 30-40% HCS-U7
   - Exclusivity option for SA government sector

2. **Technical Differentiation**
   - Shield Module = ONLY solution detecting state-level attacks
   - Offline POC = Zero risk to SASSA production systems
   - 3 patents = Defensible IP

3. **Commercial Opportunity**
   - POC: €207k (~R4.5M)
   - Year 1 Production: €600k (~R13.2M)
   - Recurring revenue (SaaS model)

4. **Next Steps**
   - Joint deck review (1 hour)
   - SASSA stakeholder intro (Cyber1 to facilitate)
   - MOU signature (partnership terms)
